University-Schedule
===================

Motivation
=====
I initially developed this as a project for a Bachelor degree and it has seen no further development since.
It still has a few bugs, but I've never had the motivation to fix them.


Description
=====
A Client - Server application (PHP - Android) that syncs the University Schedules using PHP and Java (Android) Sockets.

There is a serverside GUI that allows the editing of the Schedules.

There is a clientside GUI that allows the viewing, adding and deleting of shedules to sync.


Currently only allows one client at a time.

Server must be started via command line.
